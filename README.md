**GuidanceHub: Prototype Mentoring Platform**  <br>
GuidanceHub is a mentoring platform designed to connect mentees with mentors, offering guidance, support, and resources to help individuals reach their full potential. This repository represents the initial prototype I created when the concept of GuidanceHub first struck me. Please note that this is not the final version and serves as a stepping stone toward a more refined product.<br>
